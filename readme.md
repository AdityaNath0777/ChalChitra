### Project Overview

This project originated from the **"Chai aur Backend"** course by Hitesh Choudhary (YouTube). While the course focused on teaching the foundational backend development for the MERN stack (covering only User API endpoints), I extended the project significantly by:  
- Implementing additional APIs for features such as *videos, subscriptions, comments, tweets, playlists, likes, health checks, and dashboards* based on the provided hints.  
- Designing and implementing a **Reply API** independently.  
- Refining the schema to improve efficiency and structure.  
- Developing the **entire frontend**, which was not part of the original course scope.

### Backend Setup (Completed)

Follow these steps to set up and run the backend server:

1. **Navigate to the server directory**  
   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

2. **Create a `.env` file**  
   - Use the `server/.env.sample` file as a reference to configure your environment variables.

3. **Install dependencies**  
   ```bash
   npm i
   ```

4. **Run the development server**  
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Frontend Setup (In Progress)

Follow these steps to set up and run the frontend server:

1. **Navigate to the client directory**  
   ```bash
   cd client
   ```

2. **Configure the proxy for Vite**  
   - Create a `.env` file in the `client` directory based on the `client/.env.sample` file.

3. **Install dependencies**  
   ```bash
   npm i
   ```

4. **Run the development server**  
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
