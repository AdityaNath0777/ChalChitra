Server is a software which serves

business logic -> common term for logic to be implemented at the backend

DB is mostly always in another continent (why? -> will answer later)

API is just -> a response -> a returned value

in BackEnd we deal with three things

1) Data (username, email, etc)
2) File (txt, pdf, doc, img, etc)
3) Third Party (API) (google login, spotify login, AWS upload, etc)

## Runtime Env(s)
Node, Deno, Bun are all runtime Environments for JS

they just run JavaScript files

```file
  package.json    .env    (readme, git, lint, pretteir, etc)
src/
  index   App   constants
```
